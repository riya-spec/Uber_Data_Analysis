# Uber_Data_Analysis

Analyzed the Uber trip dataset from Kaggle, applied K-means Clustering
(Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm) on the dataset to understand the day-to-day
trips taken by the user on the Uber and identified the areas which are highly on demand
for Uber. Finally Identified total 6 clusters, stored the clusters on the centroids in terms of
latitude and longitude, used folium library to generate the map and location.

# Impact :
Realized that the centroids identified would be helpful for uber to know the hubs where they could get high ride request resulting in fatser customer service and
growth in their business.Also anayzed which cluster gets the maximum booking request
and the peak timings.
